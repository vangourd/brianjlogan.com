There aren't many coffeeshops that I go to that have had such a positive and boisterous beginning as Quigley Coffee Co. Meeting the energetic and effusively giving personality of Mr. Quigley was the initial draw. They were just getting started in the 46 Thrift Shop location and he was happy to tell his story of giving back by donating profits to the food bank because of his hardship earlier in life. 
Quigley has evolved since then into a full and rich community oriented coffeeshop experience. They have a joint board shop called funk that exists in the same space and adds to the vibe and ambiance of this shop. The mural selfie spot, comfy couch, giant wood table, and polaroid wall are just some of the unique stylings and character of this shop. 

If you pay close attention you'll notice the customers feed into this energy and their demeanor seems different than your average corporate coffeeshop. 

I'll be going here for quite some time.
