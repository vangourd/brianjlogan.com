Located on 1792 in Maitland in a shopping center right off of Ventris.

It's a Norwegian themed coffee shop. They have a La Marzocco Machine, their own roasting machine in the back, they sell bagged coffee, breakfast food, and espresso drinks. They have a small little store area for drinks and snacks.

It's a clean and friendly place that is a tried and true aesthetic for an American third wave coffee shop. The seating aims for minimalist and easy to clean up spaces but tends to be less comfortable than coffee shops with more of an investment in comfort seating options.

I do notice the Nordic influences and having just come from a Europe trip myself appreciate the little reminders.

Let's talk coffee.

I tried the **Julegris'** [yoo-le-gris] which is a Marsipan Latte with a nutty flavor. Personally I usually opt for a hazelnut latte as my test of a coffee shop but this seasonal drink sounded too tempting for me to resist. 

My wife got the vanilla latte and enjoyed her's as well. We'll definitely be keeping this spot in mind next time we're in the Maitland area.

Overall I like the unique theme and hope they lean into the Norwegian influences even moe to distinguish themselves from a very popular third wave coffee style. I just wish there was a little mocre comfy seating for those who like to code and coffee ;)
